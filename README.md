----------

</div>

KitchenView is the kitchen display system we use in our cafes. We decided to write our own application for this since alternate solutions like Fresh KDS were either broken, unsupported, expensive, or would require purchasing new equipment. Kitchen View 2.0 is the newest version of this system, completely rewritten for the modern web.

Notable Improvements in v2:
- Uses Square's Oauth APIs to enable anyone to sign up and use it
- Has an advanced filter editor to make it easy to decide what items to show on which screen.
- Uses modern technologies like websockets to ensure screens always stay up to date.

Pros:
- Anything with a modern web browser can be used as a display.
- 100% Free
- Unlimited Accounts/Locations/Screens
- Open Source, so anyone can contribute or run it on their own server.

Cons:
- Currently a work-in-progress, so not a lot of extra features are available.
- Both your Square device and the display need a reliable internet connection
- Some orders can take up to a minute to show up - This is a limitation of Square's webhook API and there's nothing I can do about it.
